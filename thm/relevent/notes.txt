SMBCLINET
	smbclient -L $ip
		lists all the shares

PROCESS
------------------

Nmap scan reveals a couple ports open, standard for windows

Using smbclient we can see there is a share with anon access
	nt4wrksv
	in the share there is passwords.txt - can get users and passwords from the file but no use

Enumerating the rest of the services, we can see another webserver on port 49663
	dir scanning 80 and 49663 we can see 49663 is a mirror of the smb service

Since nt4wrksv is writable as a user, we can upload a shell (msfvenom windows) to the server and execute it with a curl command

on the system, whoami /priv reveals tokens set, can use PrintSpoofer.exe to get root
