Strings 1

MD5 : ff395a6d528dc5724bcde9c844a0ee89 -> unimportant
strings > text.txt

Use ghidra, look in the entry funtion and it is basically there in plain text


Strings 2
-----------------

In the entry function there are a series of variables that are declared and assigned 
After a variable assigned to a F all the rest are in hex, converting them to ASCII gives the flag
Flag: FLAG{STACK-STRINGS-ARE-BEST-STRINGS}

Strings 3
-----------------

In entry, finding the location of the MD5 conversion is fairly easy given the last steps
Looking through the decompiled code, a LoadStringA function is found to be imported from WIN32USER.dll
Look up this function from the microsoft docs, the address 0x110 is where the string should be,
check the string in the memory for the flag
