- Campaigns
	- Targeted
		- Specific malware for a specfic target
		- Ex. Dark hotel, gather data from govt. orgs
	- Mass Campaigns 
		- Large scale operations that infect as many machines as possible
		- Most common malware normal users experience
- Process
	- Delivery
		- How the malware was spread to the system it is now on
		- Ex. phishing and emails, USB (stuxnet), SMB shares (wannacry)
	- Execution
		- What the payload of the malware actually does, 
		- Ex. encrypts files (ransomware), steals and transmits data (spyware), display ads (adware)
	- Maintaining persistence
		- How does the malware stay on and active on the machine after time/ user actions
	- Persistence
	- Propagation
		- Does the virus spread over a network or spread at all
- Signatures
	- Host-Based signatures
		- Usually the results of execution and persistence of the malware
		- Files being encrypted and ads being displayed
	- Network based signatures
		- If the malware makes and network based calls
		- Ransomware sending BTC to a certain address over a network
- Analysis
	- Static 
		- Analysis without running the malware on the machine
		- Signatures and checksums
	- Dynamic
		- Running the malware and abstracting what actually happened
- Checksums 
	- MD5 strings that serve as a fingerprint a file, can be uploaded to a database website to catalog known viruses


---------------- The doing ------------------------

- File Headers
	- Files without .exe can be ran as executables, the "4D 5A" header gives a executable
- PEiD 
	- Static tool to checking packing
- Obfuscation
	- Packing
		- A form of obfuscation to prevent analysis of programs 
		- Compresses a file to complicate the reversing process
		- A packer uses a compressing technique and appends an unpacking routine at the end of the code
		- The code is then not recognized as different by the OS and loads normally into memory
- Strings
	- ASCII text that is found in a binary
	- Can contain gems like passwords or addresses
