Know from notes in .100 there is a LFI vuln... but i assumed seeing the url without the notes :)
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/nav.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd
		POC for easy LFI

We know there is a LFI vuln + wordpress in web root (/var/www/html)
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/nav.php?page=../../../../var/www/html
		gives nothing, blind LFI - no feed back unless you get it

Try filters! - php filter to get the goods :)
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/nav.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php

Pulled a password for Margaret which we know is a user on the box (from /etc/passwd)

Margaret shell is very confined - cannot exit home dir and can only use like 5 commands (gay + annoying)
	can use cd BUT can use vim and nav the file system this way
		(in vim) :e /home/margaret/.config/Slack/exoported_data/secure
		can read the conversation log and get two passwords:
			STARS5678FORTUNE401 	- UBUNTU IMAGES
				migrating to the ubuntu images
			TractorHeadtorchDeskmat - 	new passsword, same username (meaning frank)

SSH into frank with the password to get a stable and sane shell

Nothing in linpeas or manual enum

Upload pspy64 to the box
	this will list all the processes running
	https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy

There is a process ran by UID = 0 (root) to call a file in the user's home dir

PYTHON LIBRARY HIJACK FOR ROOT
	see a script being run by root (apache_restart.py) on repeat (even tho nothing in cron!)
	apache_restart is not writable by us however it imports two libraries he can hijack! (urllib and call or something)
	create a new file called urllib.py with a dummy class to remove errors and a reverse shell (or any cmd)
		apache_restart will execute the dummy class in the file and essentially do nothing, then once that is executed;
		the reverse shell in the end of the script will be ran as root
		check hijack.py for exmaple!
	apache_restart will import this file instead of the real import and execute the code we injected (cool)
