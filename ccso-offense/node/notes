NOTES
---------------

Get a box with an ip - 104.39.237.154
	need to scan for it
		arp-scan or nmap -s

nmap - leads to two ports, 22 and 3000 which is weird, 3000 is a web server

Website
-----
Nothing too special, the login page redirects to /login
Gobuster wont work, everything is redirected to index

analysis of js files
	inspect the login page and look at the debug console
	can look in the js to find an api endpoint

/api/users
	has password hashes, can crack most of them using online crackstation - sha256 (weak and gay)
	myP14ceAdm1nAcc0uNT:manchester
	tom:spongebob
	mark:snowflake
	rastating:???

log in to admin panel with the creds - can download a backup file
	ends with a =, most likely b64 enc

cat myplace.backup | b64 -d > dec
file dec
	zip archive
mv dec dec.zip
unzip dec.zip
	enter the password

cracking a zip archive password
