nmap and see 80, 135, 445 open, would indicate this is windows
	gobuster and nikto show nothing substantial

Port 80 is a login, admin admin work as creds.. bruh leads to a firmware update center
Can upload a revshell to the site, get a success message but not sure where it goes to

Maybe can inject to the ?msg=SUCCESS in the url?

Forced authentication - getting a victim SMB server to call back to a controlled listener. By default the SMB server will send credentials in an attempt to login, this gives the hash which can be cracked by hashcat
