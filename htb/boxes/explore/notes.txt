ROOTING
adbd is the abd daemon, abd is a tool to remotely connect to andriod devices
when connceted to the box using the script.py, connected through ssh on port 5555
therefore can forward the tcp traffic to my localhost:5555 giving a connection that adb can use
	ssh kristi@explore.htb -L 5555:localhost:5555 -p 2222
	-p 2222 is the port ssh is running on remote host
then once a conncetion is established, can open another tab and use 
	adb -s localhost:5555 shell 
to create a shell on the connection previously forwarded
can su to root due to misconfig of adbd
