Notes
-----------------------
Always remember to check shared creds
If you see a dirty command in the script, try to run in termnal

---------------------
Process
---------------------
port 80 open running gunicorn 

Can find a directory (/data/) with gobuster
	Default is /data/4 -> can nav to /data/0 and download the pcap

In PCAP, user nathan logs into ftp with the password -> Buck3tH4TF0RM3!

Stole creds to ftp server :)

can ssh into nathan with the same creds 
User flag -> 9d44723128d5a28e40ad10b4815b9852

Looking in /var/www -> see app.py and a comment saying permissions issues with gunicorn and threads. hacky solution for now.
	Not sure what is running the script, is in capture function, maybe upload a revshell to be executed by root?
	Dont need the script! can just run the command in the terminal lol
	Root flag = 4a3c1c089113b41982614e40bb08746e
